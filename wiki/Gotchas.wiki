=== Callbacks and blocking actions ===

Remember that all NIO callbacks are done on the NIO thread, which means *no* I/O can happen while the callback is running. This means you should never make lengthy or blocking calls as a response. 


In particular watch out when implementing the following methods: 

`SocketObserver#connectionOpened(NIOSocket)`

`SocketObserver#packetReceived(NIOSocket)`

`ServerSocketObserver#newConnection(NIOSocket)`

`ConnectionAcceptor#acceptConnection(InetSocketAddress)`
