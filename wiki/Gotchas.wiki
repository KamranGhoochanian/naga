  * Remember that all NIO callbacks are done on the NIO thread, which means *no* I/O can happen while the callback is running. This means you should never make length or blocking calls as a response. In particular watch out for: `SocketObserver#connectionOpened(NIOSocket), SocketObserver#packetReceived(NIOSocket), ServerSocketObserver#newConnection(NIOSocket), ConnectionAcceptor#acceptConnection(InetSocketAddress)`
