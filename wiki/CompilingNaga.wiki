Compiling Naga from sources.

= Introduction =

How to compile naga from the sources.


= Details =

Naga itself has no external dependencies, so all code under src/main should compile fine under any circumstances.

If you want to run the tests, you need to install easymock with classextensions, follow the instructions on http://www.easymock.org/ and remember that easymockclassextension.jar has a dependency on cglib.
